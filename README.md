SMS Spam Detector
What is the Project?
The SMS Spam Detector is a machine learning tool that classifies SMS messages as spam (unwanted) or ham (legitimate). Built with Python, it uses Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization to analyze text and detect spam with high accuracy.
Project Overview
This project trains a model on a labeled dataset of SMS messages (e.g., the SMS Spam Collection dataset) to distinguish spam from legitimate messages. It includes:

train_model.py: Loads data, preprocesses it (removing duplicates, handling missing values), trains a Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF features, and saves the model and vectorizer.
spam_detector.py: A command-line interface (CLI) for real-time prediction, allowing users to input messages and get instant spam/ham classifications.
requirements.txt: Lists dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, joblib).

The model achieves high accuracy (~98% on standard datasets) by leveraging text preprocessing and balanced classification.
Real-Life Use
The SMS Spam Detector has practical applications in:

Mobile Messaging Apps: Filtering out spam texts (e.g., promotional or phishing messages) to improve user experience.
Telecom Services: Automatically blocking fraudulent SMS messages to protect customers.
Email and Chat Platforms: Adapting the model to detect spam in emails or instant messages.
Cybersecurity: Identifying phishing attempts or malicious links in text-based communications.
Personal Productivity: Helping users prioritize legitimate messages and reduce distractions.

Use by Example

Train the Model:

Download the dataset (e.g., spam.csv) and place it in the data/ folder.
Run the training script:python train_model.py
